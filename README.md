This is a simple to-do list page that has the option to cross off item, remove them from the list,
or to move them to a seperate backlog list. I created it as a simple side project to practice basic
DOM manipulation with vanilla JS. Currently, there are no backend capbilities, so once the page is
refreshed, the entries are all lost.
